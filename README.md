TP1 (Exploratory Data Analysis on Property Prices)
This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning for a property price dataset. It includes handling missing data, descriptive statistics, feature engineering, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

TP2 (Predictive Modeling on Property Prices)
This notebook applies machine learning techniques to predict property prices, using linear regression and feature scaling. It involves data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, train-test splitting, and model evaluation, leveraging Scikit-Learn and StatsModels.
